**NAMING CONVENTION** 

Variables starting with “t” or “f” represent measurements in time and frequency domain, respectively. 

Variables having “.mean” or “.std” represent mean or standard deviation measurements, respectively. 

Variables with “_X”, “_Y” or “_Z” pending at the end represent measurements done along x-, y- or z-axis, respectively.
